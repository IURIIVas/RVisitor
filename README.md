Automated robot motion control module

## Description

The module allows to assign the control functions of a wheeled robot to a separate functional unit, reducing the requirements for robot software.   

### Application area
The module provides control of DC motors taking into account information from connected sensors. The module can be used for:
* studying the basic robotic algorithms for controlling the movement of wheeled robots
* research and development of robotic platforms

### Features

* setting and maintaining speed and direction of movement
* identification of obstacles and lack of surface
* wheel odometry
* high current level detection
* configuration save
